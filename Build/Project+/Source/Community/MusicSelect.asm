Select music for match on SSS v2 [Squidgy, mawwwk]
# updated to support StageEx
# button no longer affects pages/random/back
##################################################
# Press a custom button while hovering over a stage to open the My Music screen
# Press the custom button to select the song and automatically start the match
# Press A to preview songs, or B to back out

# --CONTROL OPTIONS--
# Button to open song select
# button values : 21 (X), 20 (Y), 19 (Start/+)
.alias button = 20
# Button to select a song in song select
# selectButton values : 21 (X), 20 (Y), 23 (Start/+)
# .alias selectButton = 23 - THIS IS NOW CONTROLLED IN THE MODULE
# Recommended to use the same button for opening song select and picking a song, 
# but note that some buttons (such as Start) use a different number for each

# --CUSTOM ADDRESSES USED--
# 80002810 - we use this address for a flag that tells us what step we are on
# 80002818 - we use this address for the selected song ID
# 8000281C - we use this address for selected stage index
# 80002820 - we use this address for selected stage type
# 80002824 - we use this address for SSS page
# 80002828 - we use this address to store the current mode
# 80002830 - port 1 hidden alt
# 80002834 - port 2 hidden alt
# 80002838 - port 3 hidden alt
# 8000283C - port 4 hidden alt

# --FLAG STATES--
# 1 - going to My Music, 2 - My Music opened, 3 - song chosen, 4 - backing out of My Music, 
# 5 - returning from My Music, 6 - back to SSS, 7 - highlight chosen stage/select stage

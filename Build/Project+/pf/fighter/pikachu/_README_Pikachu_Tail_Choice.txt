Guide for Pikachu Tail
=======================================================================================

Thanks to PSA edits by MarioDox and KingJigglypuff, you have the opportunity to choose the Pikachu tail you want to use.

Simply hold side on the D-pad while loading a stage as Pikachu to swap from the default tail, to the alternate tail. 

Additional tail bones were added to accomodate this.

The following slots load the female tails by default
-03 (Goggles)
-08 (Headphones)
-09 (May Bandana)
-11 (Party Hat)

If you want an additional costume to load female tail by default you could either adjust the PSA, or in BrawlCrate swap the visbility bones for Tail and Tail2. Be sure to adjust the Iron Tail bones too, or you would swap tails whenever you use that attack.
